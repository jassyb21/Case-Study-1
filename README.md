# Case-Study-1

## Overview and Origin 

The name of the company is OTT Financial Group. 

The company was incorporated October 2006. 

The founder and CEO is Carl Cai. 

The company's mission is providing value for its clinets by building a convenient, secure and professional financial services network using technology to connect markets in North America and China. 

## Business Activities 

OTT Financial Group focuses on providing tailored financial services to address the needs of both consumers and businesses. They utilize advanced technologies and years of experience in international investment to identify, build, and deliver the financial innovations that will bring the greatest benefits to their clients. 

OTT Financial Group is continuously evolving to be a pioneer in financial technology. They have successfully built multiple lines of sustainable businesses in mobile payments, cross-border payments, big data, and cloud computing. 

OTT Financial Group operates multiple lines of business in Canada’s financial services industry including; smart payment, securities trading, foreign exchange, asset management, and e-commerce.

## Landscape 

The company's biggest competitors in this space are Block, Nuvei, and First Data.

OTT Financial Group are unfunded, whereas their competitiors have billions of dollars of funding from various investors, which can lead to larger marketing campaigns and more business growth. 

Overall, the financial services industry, more specifically financial technology (fintech), has grown exponentially over the past 5 years due to large sums of funding, as global market trends show large consumer populations within the digital media and e-commerce space. 

## Results 

As a result of market trends showcasing large consumer populations within spaces, such as e-commerce, OTT Financial Group partnered with UnionPay (credit card) in April 2020 to launch an online payment solution for card holders. Thus, expanding their business network across multiple countires and regions, generating more clients and profits. 

In 2021, the company's mobile payment service, OTT Pay, was named one of Canada’s best mobile payment companies and start-ups by mobile market analysis experts Lead Droid, alongside many notable organizations. The selection was made based on outstanding performance in innovation, growth, management, and societal impact. 

## Recommendations 

Personally, I would encourage the company to contiue to form partnerships with credit card companies that do not offer online payment solutions, and help them launch online payment systems through your service/technology that can expand your company's global outreach and offer more valued clients for business. I would also explore other avenues when forming partnerships, such as insurance companies that will provide a lot more profits and business. 

Another suggestion I would make is to outsource for funding from valued investors within the sector, as their funding and expertise can increase business growth by utilizing strategies, such as marketing campaigns, leading to greater exposure. 

To launch large-scale marketing campaigns, the company must use software and technologies for marketing efficieny and global outreach, such as HubSpot and Adobe Campaign.
